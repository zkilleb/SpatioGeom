def breakSegsAndPreserveSegLabels( segs, la, lb ):
    '''
    `segs` is a list of segments that defines cycles. It is of the usual format: [((x1,y1),(x2,y2)), ... , ((xn,yn),(xm,ym))] 

    `la` and `lb` are lists of **integers**, are parallel to `segs`, and carry label infromation for the area *above* (la) and *below* (lb) its associated seg.
    
    #. Each cycle is assumed to be a well-formed, simple cycle. 
    #. Each cyle is assumed to carry a **unique label**.
    #. Segments can be in ANY order in `segs`, just as long as the list is parallel to `la` and `lb`
    #. `la` and `lb` are parallel to `segs`.  If the interior of the cycle lies above the segment, then `la` will have the cycle's labeland `lb` will have a value of `0`.  Vice versa if the interior of the cycle lies below the segment.  Note that a cycle may correspond to a *hole geometry* within a region, in which case the cycle will be labeled such that the cycle label lies on the *exterior* of the cycle.
    #. Segments from one cycle can intersect segments from another cycle, but indeividual cycles are simple (non-self intersecting)

    The basic idea is to label a bunch of cycles using, for instance `hsegLibrary.labelUniqueCycles()`, then just append them all to a segment list and label lists, and call this function.

    Note that duplicate segments are maintained with their original labels.  Therefore, this function can be used to break segments intersecting segments between cycles, then simply retrieve the individual cycles by label number.

    **Input:**

    #. `segs`: a list of segments.  It is assumed that the segments form simple cycles.  Each simple cycle is well formed.  Segments from different cycles can intersect.
    #. `la`: a list of labels indicating if the interior of a cycle lies above the corresponding segment.  `la` is parallel to `lb` and `segs`
    #. `lb`: same as `la`, but indicates if the interior of a cycle lies below the corresponding segment.

    **Output:**

    #. a list of segments.  No two segments in the list will intersect in thier interiors.  The only exception is that overlapping segments from the input will be duplicated.  One instance of the overlapping seg will exist for each cycle that contains the seg.
    #. a list of above labels
    #. a list of below labels

        #. This function assumes that no two segments in `segs` intersect in thier interiors EXCEPT for pairs of segments that are equal.  That is, if two cycles share a portion of a boundary, those segs are dupicated for each cycle that shares a boundary; furthermore, each duplciate is labeled for its associated cycle

        #. The exterior label is `-1`

        To enforce point 1 above, simply use the `breakSegsAndPreserveSegLabels()` function.
    
    `segs` is a list of segments that defines cycles. It is of the usual format: [((x1,y1),(x2,y2)), ... , ((xn,yn),(xm,ym))] 

    `la` and `lb` are lists of **integers**, are parallel to `segs`, and carry label infromation for the area *above* (la) and *below* (lb) its associated seg.
    
    
    The purpose of this function is to create a map from a collection of individual cycles, so two cycles may overlap.  

    Because we are creating a map, the idea is to treat the input cycles as imposing a spatial partition on the embedding space.  This function will assign to each region in that partition the labels of all cycles that cover that region.  Thus, an area covered by 2 cycles will carry the labels of both of those cycles.

  
    It is assumed that input segments have correct labeling.
    
    **Input:**

    #. `segs` a list of segs in the format [ ((x1,y1),(x2,y2)), ... ,((xn,yn),(xm,ym))].  The segs form cycles.  **Segments cannot intersect each other, excet for overlapping segs where two cycles share a boundary**. 
    #. `la` a list of labels that is a parallel list to the segments (item 0 in la corresponds to item 0 in lb corresponds to item 0 in segs, etc).
    #. `lb` a list of labels that is a parallel list to the segments (item 0 in la corresponds to item 0 in lb corresponds to item 0 in segs, etc).
    
    `la` and `lb` are lists of integers.  It is assumed each cycle simply has a single integer as a label for this function
   
   **Returns:**

    #. A list of segs forming a map
    #. Parallel la and lb arrays with label IDs corresponding to the segs
    #. A dictionary to translate label indexes in the la and lb arrays to a set indicating all input labels for all input cycles that cover the corresponding region.
