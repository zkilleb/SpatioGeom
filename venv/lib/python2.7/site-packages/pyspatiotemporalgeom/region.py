        Creates a spatial partition from a set of regions.  Each resulting segment will also have a label that

        So, we essentially get a heat map of vector regions.  Each segment in a cycle in the resulting partition 
        will have the same interior label (for the interior of the cycle), since that cycle represents the area covered 
        by a fixed numeber of input regions.

        **ASSUMPTIONS**
        
        1. segList contains line segments representing a set of well-formed regions
        2. laList and lbList are parallel arrays with segList indicating the labels of their associated segment. 
        3. laList and lbList contain values of 1 and -1 (1 for interior, -1 for exterior)
        4. See the following paper for details: M. McKenney, B. Olsen, "Algorithms for Fundamental Spatial Aggregate Operations Over Regions," BIGSPATIAL at 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, November 2013, Orlando, FL, USA.

        input:
          
        **segList**: A list of line segments representing a SET of well formed regions.  To generate this set from a 2 hseg representations, you would extract the segs from each hseg list, and then concatenate them into a single list.

        **laList**: a list of label values.  The first value corresponds to the above label of the first segment in the seg list, the second corresponds to the second segment in the segList, etc. MUST HAVE A VALUE OF -1 (exterior)  or 1 (interior).

        **lbList**: Similar to laList, but representing the label (whether the interior or extior of the associated region) lies below the segment.  MUST HAVE A VALUE OF -1 (exterior)  or 1 (interior).
